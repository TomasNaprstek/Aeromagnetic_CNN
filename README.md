# Convolution Neural Network for Aeromagnetic Interpretation of Lineaments
This project holds the trained CNN model used in the paper:

The python script will load in the trained CNN model and apply it to a new dataset using its moving-window approach. For an example of its usage, it can be run and applied to the test_model.csv dataset, which is the same as the one used in the above paper. It was created using
